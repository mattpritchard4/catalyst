<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    This application is designed to allow players and Flame-Tenders to create
    catalysts and embers for the dark immersive fantasy roleplaying game, <em>
    Within the Ring of Fire</em>.  After entering basic information and
    statistics, this application will automatically calculate derived stats
    and keep a digital record of the progress of a catalyst.  Additionally,
    a pdf can be generated to print the catalyst mask and share digitally with
    others.
